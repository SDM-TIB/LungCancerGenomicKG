# LungCancerGenomicKG

Projetc iASiS https://project-iasis.eu/ is an EU funded project that seeks to pave the way for precision medicine approaches by utilising insights from patient data. It aims to combine information from medical records, imaging databases and genomics data to enable more personalised medicine approaches in two disease areas including lung cancer.

Precision oncology and personalized medicine, on the other hand, rely on the accurate integration and interpretation of genomic data including variants to allow individualized treatment selection, diagnosis, prediction, and prognosis.

Therefore, as part of iASiS project, SDM team work on collecting, process, and semantify genomic data from open source data bases and integrated them into a KG along with patient sequencing data.
